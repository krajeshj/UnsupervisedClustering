# UnsupervisedClustering
We're trying to learn more about how  customers behave, and  can use their behavior (whether or not they purchased something based on an offer) as a way to group similar minded customers together. We then study those groups to look for patterns and trends which can help us formulate future offers.

The first dataset contains information about each offer such as the month it is in effect and several attributes about the wine that the offer refers to: the variety, minimum quantity, discount, country of origin and whether or not it is past peak. The second dataset in the second worksheet contains transactional data -- which offer each customer responded to.

Several techniques are used to identify the right number of Sgments all the Custumers can be grouped to.

Kmeans Clustering algorith is used for Clustering.
The Clusters are are also visualized by Principal Components Analysis.
Finally several metrics to evaluate alternative Clustreing Methods are used.
